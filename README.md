Electricity Consumption Forecasting
This project focuses on forecasting monthly electricity consumption using time series analysis. It compares the performance of two models, ARIMA and LSTM, to understand their effectiveness in predicting future consumption patterns.

Project Overview
The dataset consists of monthly electricity consumption records spanning over 397 months. Using this data, we employ ARIMA and LSTM models to forecast future consumption and evaluate each model's performance.

Dataset
The dataset contains:

Date: Timestamps for each record, covering specific days (first of each month and select other dates).
Consumption: Monthly electricity consumption data in kilowatt-hours (kWh).
Models
1. ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)
Description: A statistical model suitable for stationary time series data with a well-defined trend or seasonality.
Implementation: Uses differencing, autoregressive, and moving average components to capture patterns in the time series.
2. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
Description: A deep learning model capable of capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data.
Implementation: Uses LSTM layers to handle non-linear patterns and potential seasonality in the time series.

Usage
Data Preprocessing:

Prepare and clean the dataset to ensure it is suitable for model training.
Run data_preprocessing.ipynb for data exploration and preprocessing steps.
Training:

Train the ARIMA model using the train_arima.py script or arima_training.ipynb.
Train the LSTM model using the train_lstm.py script or lstm_training.ipynb.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the models based on performance metrics such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error).
Compare results to assess the strengths of each model in forecasting monthly electricity consumption.
Forecasting:

Generate future forecasts using the trained models.
Save and analyze the forecast results in the results/ directory.
Results
This project provides a comparative analysis of the ARIMA and LSTM models, evaluating their accuracy and generalization capabilities for electricity consumption forecasting. Key results are saved in the results/ folder and include performance metrics and visualizations of forecasted trends.
